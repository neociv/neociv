## Examples

To run the examples you'll need [cargo-make](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/) - this is because there is a submodule for the current [neociv-contrib](https://github.com/neociv/neociv-contrib) content that is used and pointed to by changing the `NEOCIV_CONTENT_ROOT` environment variable.
